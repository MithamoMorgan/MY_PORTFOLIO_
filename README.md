**Repository:** [Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Diabetes_Prediction)

**Tech Stack:** Pytho, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on various medical parameters. It uses historical data to train a machine learning model that can predict diabetes based on factors like age, glucose levels, BMI & others.

The primary focus of this project was to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms (specifically XGBoost) can be used to make predictions in healthcare applications.

### Key Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model Building ()
* Model Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, confusion matrix, Recall, F1- Score
* Visualizations

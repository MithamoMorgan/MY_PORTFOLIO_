**Repository:** [Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Diabetes_Prediction)

**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on various medical parameters using a **streamlit app**. It uses historical data to train a machine learning model that can predict diabetes based on factors like age, glucose levels, BMI, HbA1c & others.

The primary focus of this project was to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms (specifically XGBoost) can be used to make predictions in healthcare applications.

### Key Features

* **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Model Building** (Logisctic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost Classifier)
* **Model Evaluation:** using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Confusion Matrix, Recall, F1- Score
* **User Input Format:** User can input their health data (e.g., age, glucose level, BMI) via a user friendly streamlit form.
* **Real-time Prediction:** This app predicts wheather a person is at risk of diabetes based on input data using a macchine learning model.
* **Visualizations**
